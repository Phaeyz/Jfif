# StartOfScan class

A segment for the start-of-scan.

```csharp
public class StartOfScan : Segment
```

## Public Members

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| [StartOfScan](StartOfScan/StartOfScan.md)() | The default constructor. |
| [ComponentDatas](StartOfScan/ComponentDatas.md) { get; set; } | The component data is used to describe the image's color components and their respective Huffman tables. |
| [EndingDctCoefficient](StartOfScan/EndingDctCoefficient.md) { get; set; } | The ending DCT coefficient. For a baseline sequential JPEG, this is usually set to `63`, covering all alternating current (AC) coefficients. |
| [ImageContent](StartOfScan/ImageContent.md) { get; set; } | The scanned image content immediately following the segment. |
| [StartingDctCoefficient](StartOfScan/StartingDctCoefficient.md) { get; set; } | The starting DCT coefficient. For a baseline sequential JPEG, this value is typically set to `0`, which means that the scan will start from the direct current (DC) coefficient. |
| [SuccessiveApproximationBitPositionHigh](StartOfScan/SuccessiveApproximationBitPositionHigh.md) { get; set; } | Specifies the point at which successive approximation begins, indicating the bit position for the first scan of a particular set of coefficients. Used in progressive JPEGs and is set to `0` in baseline JPEGs. |
| [SuccessiveApproximationBitPositionLow](StartOfScan/SuccessiveApproximationBitPositionLow.md) { get; set; } | Specifies the point at which successive approximation ends, indicating the bit position for the final scan of a particular set of coefficients. Used in progressive JPEGs and is set to `0` in baseline JPEGs. |
| override [ReadFromStreamAsync](StartOfScan/ReadFromStreamAsync.md)(…) | Reads the segment from the stream, hydrating the properties of the segment. |
| override [ValidateAndComputeLength](StartOfScan/ValidateAndComputeLength.md)() | Validates all properties of the segment such that the segment is ready for serialization, and computes the body length of the segment. |
| override [WriteOutOfBandToStreamAsync](StartOfScan/WriteOutOfBandToStreamAsync.md)(…) |  |
| override [WriteToStreamAsync](StartOfScan/WriteToStreamAsync.md)(…) | Writes the segment to the stream. |
| struct [ComponentData](StartOfScan.ComponentData.md) | The component data is used to describe the image's color components and their respective Huffman tables. |
