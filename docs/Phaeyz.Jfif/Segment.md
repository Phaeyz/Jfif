# Segment class

The base class for all segments.

```csharp
public abstract class Segment
```

## Public Members

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| [HasLength](Segment/HasLength.md) { get; } | Determines whether or not if the segment has a length field with potential data after it. |
| [Key](Segment/Key.md) { get; } | A segment key which uniquely identifies a mapping to a segment. |
| abstract [ReadFromStreamAsync](Segment/ReadFromStreamAsync.md)(…) | Reads the segment from the stream, hydrating the properties of the segment. |
| override [ToString](Segment/ToString.md)() | Returns a friendly string representation of the segment. |
| abstract [ValidateAndComputeLength](Segment/ValidateAndComputeLength.md)() | Validates all properties of the segment such that the segment is ready for serialization, and computes the body length of the segment. |
| virtual [WriteOutOfBandToStreamAsync](Segment/WriteOutOfBandToStreamAsync.md)(…) | Writes out-of-band data to the stream. It is optional for segments to implement this method. |
| abstract [WriteToStreamAsync](Segment/WriteToStreamAsync.md)(…) | Writes the segment to the stream. |
