# Segment.ReadFromStreamAsync method

Reads the segment from the stream, hydrating the properties of the segment.

```csharp
public abstract ValueTask ReadFromStreamAsync(MarshalStream stream, SegmentLength segmentLength, 
    CancellationToken cancellationToken)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| stream | The stream to read from. |
| segmentLength | The remaining length of the segment on the stream. The caller may deduct from this object as it reads to prevent from reading too much. |
| cancellationToken | A cancellation token which may be used to cancel the operation. |

## Return Value

A task which is completed when the segment has been read.

## Remarks

It is expected that the method reads *segmentLength* bytes from the stream. If less is read, it will lead to corruption. More is allowed depending on the circumstance, such as handling out-of-band data.
