public virtual ValueTask WriteOutOfBandToStreamAsync(MarshalStream stream, 
    CancellationToken cancellationToken)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| stream | The stream to write to. |
| cancellationToken |  |

## Return Value

A task which is completed when the segment has been written.

## Remarks

Out-of-band content is content which is not part of the segment itself. An example of this is content which appears after a start-of-scan segment.
